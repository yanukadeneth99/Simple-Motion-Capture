# Motion Capture

This Program instantiates the camera and loads the first frame as the main image. Whenever there is motion from the 1st frame, that motion is captured and a bounding box will be displayed.

## Run

- Run using `python Capture.py` or `python3 Capture.py`
- Make sure to not create any motion for the first frame
- Move objects into the frame to see the bounding box
